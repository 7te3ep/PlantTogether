   Plant together is an anonymous, ephemeral, and chill chat.
   <br>
   <br>
   The aim is to enable people to express themselves freely, in a caring environment.
   <br>
   <br>
   Why a plant?
   <br>
   <br>
   The more you talk, the more it grows. If no one talks for 1 day, it dies! So this plant is a participatory project,
   and it's pretty too.
